# LappyMan

## Description

The developed application is in the form of a system that can recommend a product based on the input data provided by the prospective user. 
This application is developed using AI system features with functions in the domain of data science. 
The project, titled "Development of an Artificial Intelligence Website System for Recommending Personal Computer (PC) Choices Based on Application System Requirements on the Windows Operating System," aims to address the concerns and confusion prevalent in society when selecting a laptop. 
The application, named "LappyMan," provides a solution to help prospective users receive recommendations for their best laptop choices.


## Sample Visualizations

### Data Acquistion

The data collection process involves extracting System Requirements data from 20 different applications, along with the corresponding CPU hardware components that match these System Requirements. I categorize the costs associated with the CPU hardware components into three categories: Standard Cost, ranging approximately from Rp 5,000,000 to Rp 8,000,000. The next category is Sultan Cost, falling within the range of approximately Rp 8,000,000 to Rp 15,000,000. The final category is the God-like (Dewa) Cost, with a price range of approximately Rp 15,000,000 to Rp 50,000,000.

### Prediction path explanations

Based on the discussed project implementation process, this application is developed with a data modeling program that utilizes the decision tree algorithm. The modeling program consists of variable data, including input data values, to assist the computer program in performing calculations or computations to classify data in the form of a tree.

### Evaluation

Next is to analyze the quality of the machine learning model program that has been created by considering the training and test data used, as well as the accuracy values of the model to determine how accurately the system classifies input variables with their corresponding values. After analyzing and computing the program, the results obtained include a training data value of 0.9851 or 98.51%, and a test data value of 0.9184 or 91.84%, with a model accuracy value of 0.91 or 91%.
